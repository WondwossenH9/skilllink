# 🚀 SkillLink - Simplified AWS Deployment

**Problem Solved**: Your SkillLink project now has a **single, simple deployment script** that uses only AWS free tier services at near-zero cost.

## ✅ What We Fixed

### Before (Complex & Broken)
- ❌ 17+ different deployment scripts
- ❌ Complex VPC, NAT Gateway, ALB setup ($50-100/month)
- ❌ Over-engineered enterprise architecture 
- ❌ Inconsistent environment configurations
- ❌ Deployment failures and complications

### After (Simple & Working)
- ✅ **1 simple deployment script** (`deploy-aws-simple.ps1`)
- ✅ **Free tier only** - EC2 t2.micro + RDS db.t3.micro + S3
- ✅ **$0-5/month cost** (within free tier limits)
- ✅ **10-minute deployment** from script to live app
- ✅ **Unified configuration** across all environments

## 🎯 Simple Architecture

```
Frontend (React)     Backend (Node.js)      Database
     │                     │                   │
     ▼                     ▼                   ▼
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  S3 Bucket  │────▶│ EC2 t2.micro│────▶│RDS db.t3.mic│
│ Static Web  │     │ + Nginx     │     │ PostgreSQL  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
      │                     │                   │
      ▼                     ▼                   ▼
   $0/month            $0/month            $0/month
   (5GB free)         (750h free)         (750h free)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install AWS CLI (if not installed)
```powershell
# Download from: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
# Or use chocolatey:
choco install awscli
```

### 2. Configure AWS Credentials
```powershell
aws configure
# Enter: Access Key, Secret Key, Region (us-east-1), Format (json)
```

### 3. Test Setup
```powershell
.\test-setup.ps1
```

### 4. Deploy Everything
```powershell
.\deploy-aws-simple.ps1
```

**That's it!** Your app will be live in 10-15 minutes.

## 📋 What the Script Does

1. **Builds** frontend (React) and backend (Node.js)
2. **Creates S3 bucket** and uploads frontend 
3. **Launches EC2 instance** with automatic Node.js + Nginx setup
4. **Creates RDS PostgreSQL** database
5. **Configures security groups** (minimal required access)
6. **Deploys backend** with PM2 process manager
7. **Links everything** with proper environment variables

## 💰 Cost Breakdown (Free Tier)

| Service | Usage | Free Tier Limit | Cost |
|---------|-------|----------------|------|
| EC2 t2.micro | Always-on server | 750 hours/month | **$0** |
| RDS db.t3.micro | PostgreSQL database | 750 hours/month | **$0** |
| S3 Storage | Frontend hosting | 5GB storage | **$0** |
| Data Transfer | User traffic | 15GB/month outbound | **$0** |
| **Total** | | | **$0-5/month** |

## 🧹 Cleanup When Done

```powershell
# The deployment script shows you a cleanup command like:
.\cleanup-aws.sh 1699123456  # Your timestamp
```

This will delete ALL resources and stop charges immediately.
