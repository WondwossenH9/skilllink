# üö® SECURITY CLEANUP - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Files Removed for Security
The following files have been removed due to security vulnerabilities:

### ‚ùå Removed Files:
1. `deploy-backend-app.ps1` - Contained hardcoded database password
2. `quick-backend-deploy.sh` - Contained hardcoded credentials
3. `infrastructure/deployment-config.env` - Contained sensitive configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Actions Required:

#### 1. Rotate All Exposed Credentials
- **Database Password**: Change immediately in AWS RDS
- **JWT Secrets**: Generate new secrets
- **Any AWS Access Keys**: Rotate if they were used

#### 2. Clean Git History
If these files were committed to git:
```bash
# Remove sensitive files from git history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch deploy-backend-app.ps1 quick-backend-deploy.sh infrastructure/deployment-config.env' \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push to remove from remote
git push origin --force --all
```

#### 3. Verify No Sensitive Data
Search your repository for any remaining sensitive data:
```bash
# Search for potential secrets
grep -r "SkillLink2025" .
grep -r "skilllink-production-jwt-secret" .
grep -r "34.228.73.44" .
grep -r "i-016e9c49216f49b35" .
```

## ‚úÖ Secure Alternatives Implemented

### 1. AWS Secrets Manager
- All credentials stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager
- Automatic rotation capabilities
- IAM-based access control

### 2. Terraform Infrastructure
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- No hardcoded values
- Secure variable management

### 3. GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Automated, secure deployment pipeline
- No manual credential handling
- Built-in security scanning

### 4. Containerized Deployment
- Docker containers for consistent deployment
- Security scanning in CI/CD
- Non-root user execution

## Next Steps

1. **Follow the Production Deployment Guide**
2. **Use the new secure deployment methods**
3. **Monitor for any unauthorized access**
4. **Regular security audits**

## Emergency Contacts
- AWS Support: If you suspect credential compromise
- Security Team: For incident response
- Database Admin: For credential rotation

**This cleanup is critical for the security of your application. Do not skip these steps.**
