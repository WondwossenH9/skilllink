# ðŸš¨ SECURITY EMERGENCY FIXES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND

### 1. **EXPOSED CREDENTIALS** (CRITICAL)
- Database password `SkillLink2025!` hardcoded in multiple files
- JWT secrets exposed in deployment scripts
- RDS endpoints and connection strings in plaintext
- EC2 instance details and IPs exposed

### 2. **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

#### A. Rotate All Exposed Credentials
1. **Change RDS password immediately**
2. **Generate new JWT secrets**
3. **Rotate any AWS access keys used**
4. **Update all hardcoded values**

#### B. Remove Sensitive Files
- Delete any `.env.deployment` files from repository
- Remove hardcoded credentials from scripts
- Clean git history if credentials were committed

#### C. Implement AWS Secrets Manager
- Store all secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
- Use IAM roles for service access
- Never store secrets in code or config files

## NEXT STEPS
1. Follow the security implementation plan below
2. Test all changes in a development environment first
3. Deploy to production only after security validation
4. Monitor for any unauthorized access attempts

## EMERGENCY CONTACTS
- AWS Support: If you suspect credential compromise
- Security Team: For incident response
- Database Admin: For credential rotation
